# NFL-Winning-Seasons

This project features data from stathead.com. The data consists of total first downs, touchdowns, points, win-loss percentage, punts, and more. Throughout the process, I deal with nulls. I explore the data and preform a linear regression and multiple regression in order to see what exactly contributes to a winning season (and what doesn't). I was surprised by one of the results and maybe you will be too! I had a lot of fun with this project and I hope you enjoy reading it.
